# Chest-Xray-Pneumonia-Detection-Neural-Network-Model
This project aims to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on a dataset of chest X-ray images and evaluated for its performance. The project is ongoing, and I aim to fine-tune the model in the future. If you are seeing this, it means I am still working on the project.
